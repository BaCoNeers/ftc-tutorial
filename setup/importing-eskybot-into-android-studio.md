# Importing EskyBot into Android Studio

We have just cloned the EskyBot git repository, now we need to import it into Android Studio. The EskyBot project uses [Gradle ](https://gradle.org/)as a build system and Android Studio knows how to work with Gradle but needs to create some additional Project Files during the import process. You will only need to perform this import once.

* Start Android Studio and select _**Import project**_

Or if you already have a project open...

And select the directory where you cloned the EskyBot project
