# Switch to the tutorial02 branch

Switch to the tutorial02 branch \(See [Tutorial 1](/tutorial1/switch-to-the-tutorial1-branch.md)\). Once you have checked out the tutorial02 branch your TeamCode folder should look like:

![](/assets/tut2project1.png)

This has all the files from Tutorial 1and also some additional classes from the FGCExamples directory in FgCommon. These classes make writing an OpMode easier to write and handles error conditions better.

You might also want to look at the LoopTimer\[1-3\] classes. They each have the @Disabled annotation meaning they will not populate the OpMode menu on the DriverStation.
