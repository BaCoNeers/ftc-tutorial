# The Project Files

Once you have switched to the tutorial01 branch you should see something like to following in the top left of Android Studio.

There are 4 main elements here:

* **FGCExamples** is some example code from the FGC 2017 season we will look at in a later tutorial
* **FtcRobotController **is the actual RobotController app that gets installed onto the RobotController. Most of this is unmodifiable by you and it is unlikely you will ever need to make changes in this folder.
* **TeamCode **is where you will edit your code, it is merged and transferred to the RobotController with the RobotController app. 
* **Gradle Scripts** contains the gradle build scripts for the app. It is unlikely you will need to edit these files.

This project includes 3 opmodes
